# Sebi's Code Samples

This is a small compilation of code I've written over the years. 

## Break down

I tried to organize the code into logical groupings. Drupal for example can understandably be tucked into the php folder but I didn't feel like doing it that way. :D

## Reminder

Keep in mind some of the code may have been modified for display purposes and removing/addition of context in some situations to better illustrate what was written.
